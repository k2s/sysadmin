# Setup page VM for delta.chat & download.delta.chat

For questions: [compl4xx@testrun.org](mailto:compl4xx@testrun.org)

This is how I set up the VM for delta.chat & the download page. The reasons
were to migrate away from netlify, and to have a download space where we can
push deliverables in automated release scripts.

## Create the VPS

The VPS is running at greenhost.nl. I selected the following parameters during
VPS creation:

* 2 GB Ram
* 1 CPU
* 200 GB Disk Space
* Location: Amsterdam
* OS only: Debian 9 (stretch)
* SSH key: emil
* Hostname: page
* Advanced options: enable API (not sure whether we need it)

It told me to login with `ssh root@37.218.242.41`.

## Setting up Users

I first executed `apt update && apt upgrade -y` to bring the server up-to-date.
Then I installed vim and man.

I created an `emil` user and added it to the `sudo` group.

When I played around with sudo, it always gave me the following error: `sudo:
unable to resolve host page`. Because that was odd, I added the following line
to `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.1.1	page
```

The error stopped appearing afterwards.

### Passwordless sudo

Later (2019-11-13), I configured sudo so that users in the sudo group don't
need a password anymore. I committed it to etckeeper.

## SSH config

First I copied `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` to
`/home/emil/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and tested it, to make sure I could login as
the emil user.

Then I edited the SSH config to forbid root login, change the port to 42022,
and forbid password login, to secure the server.

But when I tested it, I received a connection timeout for port 42022. I set it
back to 22, and it worked again; the login message told me that the firewall
only allows the ports 22, 80, and 443. Fine, then we'll just use the normal
port, I guess. At least the usernames aren't as easy to guess, and root is
forbidden.

A copy of the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file is in this repository.

## Further Server Configuration

Sources:
* https://github.com/codespeaknet/sysadmin/blob/master/docs/notes.rst

Now I installed etckeeper, to keep track of changes in the server
configuration.  (If you change something in the /etc directory, please run
etckeeper commit "$message" afterwards.)

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install etckeeper
echo "*-" >> /etc/.gitignore
```

Also, two other basics:

```
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo update-alternatives --config editor  # choose vim
sudo etckeeper commit "vim as default editor"
```

## Setting up nginx + jekyll

### Let's Encrypt

Sources:
* https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/debianstretch-nginx
* https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/

To set up Let's Encrypt with certbot, There first needs to be a running nginx:

```
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

That's it. Now we can install certbot and let it take care of the TLS
configuration etc.:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/certbot.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx -t stretch-backports
sudo certbot --nginx
```

The last command asks some questions. I answered them like this:

```
$ sudo certbot --nginx

```

In the mid of it I realized that of course delta.chat is not yet pointing to
the server, so the Let's Encrypt ACME handshake can't work.  So I cancelled it
and chose to proceed with the jekyll setup first, so we can do the Let's
Encrypt handshake when we want to migrate completely.

### Jekyll

Sources:
* http://briancain.net/using-jekyll-and-nginx/
* https://github.com/deltachat/provider-db/blob/master/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml

For the jekyll setup, we need to configure the deltachat-pages repository so it
builds the html pages in a docker container, and copies them to the
`/var/www/html` directory on the server, which is served to the outside by
nginx.

So first I added a new user `jekyll` for GitHub to login, without sudo, but
push rights to `/var/www/html`. I saved the password to my personal password
manager.

```
sudo adduser jekyll
sudo chown root:jekyll /var/www/html/
sudo chmod 775 /var/www/html
```

Then I generated a SSH key for jekyll on my local machine.  I also added the
SSH key of jekyll to `/home/jekyll/.ssh/authorized_keys`, so GitHub can login
there.

Afterwards I created the two CI scripts in
https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/pull/188, and added the jekyll
username and its private SSH key to the github secrets of the deltachat-pages
repository. This way the CI scripts can access them.

As I know restarted the tests, the site was available at
`http://37.218.242.41/_site/en/` - a huge success :)

Most of the links were broken first though. I had to make some changes to
`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` to fix them. Afterwards I renamed the config
file to delta.chat and linked to it from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` to make it
active. A copy of the file is in this repository as well.

**To do:** The links to the blogposts at https://delta.chat/en/blog still don't
work, i.e. they always point to the main page, not to the preview. Inserting
the PR ID to the URL is a workaround, until we have fixed this.

### Download directory

So I created the `/var/www/html/download/android/` directory, and used wget to
get the latest gplay apk release there. The goal was to get this link working:
http://download.delta.chat/android/deltachat-gplay-release-0.930.2.apk

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/download/android
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/download/desktop
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/download/ios
sudo chown jekyll:jekyll /var/www/html/download -R
cd /var/www/html/download/android
sudo wget https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/releases/download/preview-v0.930.2/deltachat-gplay-release-0.930.2.apk
```

Then I created a new nginx config file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`,
download.delta.chat, and configured it to listen to the URL
download.delta.chat. It is supposed to return a file, if it exists, and
redirect to https://delta.chat/en/download, if there is no file.

I linked to it from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` to activate it, and reloaded
nginx:

```
sudo ln -rs /etc/nginx/sites-available/download.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/download.delta.chat
sudo service nginx reload
```

The new config file is in this repository, too.

In the end I added a DNS entry to netlify.com, to make download.delta.chat
available from the internet:

```
A	download	3600	37.218.242.41
```

The link works now, so great :) 

### DNS Problems With Netlify

So finally the point came to change DNS and do Let's Encrypt.
First I wanted to create the following DNS entry:

```
A	@	180	37.218.242.41
```

Problem: Netlify doesn't let you delete certain DNS entry, and this one was
conflicting with a non-deletable one. I decided to come back later, and first
do Let's Encrypt for download.delta.chat.

### Let's Encrypt for download.delta.chat

Setting up Let's Encrypt for download.delta.chat was super easy, basically just
one command at this point:

```

### Hardening Login Security of jekyll

Source: https://serverfault.com/a/83857

When we configured the GitHub actions to push, we had to give the private key
of jekyll to GitHub (as a GitHub secret). It's only accessible for members of
the deltachat GitHub organization, and for GitHub of course. So I decided we
had to limit access of the key to scp, with the rssh tool.

I set it up like this:

```
sudo apt install rssh
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/rssh jekyll
cd /home/jekyll
sudo chmod u-w * -R
sudo chmod u-w .* -R
sudo vim /etc/rssh.conf
```

In the config file, I basically only uncommented `allowscp`.  I committed it to
etckeeper, but a copy is also in this repository.

#### Allowing rsync

Later we realized we also wanted to copy symlinks, so we could make a link for
stable releases. This is only possible with rsync, not with scp. So I also
allowed rsync in the rssh config.

### Changing DNS of delta.chat

To change the DNS entry of delta.chat to 37.218.242.41, we first needed to
migrate our DNS servers away from netlify, towards Hetzner.

to do: describe migration

### Let's Encrypt for delta.chat 2nd try

So I tried again to ask for a delta.chat Let's Encrypt cert:

```
$ sudo certbot --nginx
[sudo] password for emil: 
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Plugins selected: Authenticator nginx, Installer nginx

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: delta.chat
   Type:   unauthorized
   Detail: Invalid response from
   https://delta.chat/.well-known/acme-challenge/LYgfZRe-pDpWCD9CBAX2wB0PMmDlKZQrTF7ItkNO0x8

   name=\"viewport\" content"

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A/AAAA record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address.
```

Apparently delta.chat still pointed to 104.198.14.52, the old ip. Probably the
minimum TTL of 3600 was responsible for that. I didn't have a whole hour time
to wait for this, so I changed the IP back to 104.198.14.52 in the Hetzner DNS
settings and decided to try again another time.

The next day I tried again:

```

```

This time it worked! https://delta.chat resolved well and showed the usual
delta.chat website.

### Subdomains: www & master

Now I only had to point the CNAME records for www and master to `delta.chat.`,
to get rid of netlify completely:

```
master               180 IN CNAME   delta.chat.
www                  180 IN CNAME   delta.chat.
```

Author: missytake@systemli.org

On 2020-02-20, I was notified that both master.delta.chat and www.delta.chat
resulted in 403 errors. I adjusted their nginx configs to redirect to
delta.chat. This resolved the error.

#### Let's Encrypt for www and master

After that, I also had to add Let's Encrypt certificates for www and master. So
I copied the default nginx configuration for delta.chat to www and master, and
enabled it:

```
emil@page:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo cp delta.chat www.delta.chat
emil@page:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo cp delta.chat master.delta.chat
emil@page:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo ln -rs /etc/nginx/sites-available/www.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/www.delta.chat
emil@page:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ sudo ln -rs /etc/nginx/sites-available/master.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/master.delta.chat
```

After that, `sudo service nginx reload` threw an error: `nginx: [emerg] a
duplicate default server for 0.0.0.0:80 in
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/master.delta.chat:106`.  So I adjusted the nginx
configuration of master and www, so there was only one default_server,
delta.chat.

After reloading nginx, I could install Let's Encrypt certificates for them as
well.

I committed the changes to etckeeper. The nginx configs are in this repository.

### Adding former netlify redirects

On 2019-11-13 we realized that the [old redirects](
https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/blob/d4034e0c65dfcbc2a54e07975857fe91939d6d07/_redirects)
which worked under netlify didn't work anymore. So I added them to the nginx
config of delta.chat, reloaded the nginx server, and committed it to etckeeper.

## That's it!

So now delta.chat is hosted at greenhost.nl.

### Known Issues

~~The preview links seem to work mostly fine, but if you want to click on the
blogposts, you only get a link to the blogposts deployed on production. The
workaround is to paste the commit sha into the URL.~~ **edit: fixed.**

If you open a Pull Request at https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/,
you only get a preview link at the second commit. Background:
https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Publishing-download-links-in-the-check-details-instead-of/m-p/37275/highlight/false#M2881

## Staging

Later I wanted to create a staging site to be able to try out different nginx
configurations with the normal site content.  For this reason, I created the
staging.delta.chat subdomain at hetzner, copied and adjusted the delta.chat for
staging.delta.chat, and linked to it in sites-enabled to activate it.  Then I
executed certbot to create a Let's Encrypt cert for it.

```
sudo cp delta.chat staging.delta.chat
sudo vim staging.delta.chat 
sudo ln -rs /etc/nginx/sites-available/staging.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/staging.delta.chat
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Then I realized there were javascript redirects in
`/var/www/html/_site/index.html` which were giving me a hard time. I wanted to
debug them on staging.delta.chat, so I did the following:

```
cp -r /var/www/html/_site /var/www/html/staging
sed -ie "s/html\/_site/html\/staging/g" /etc/nginx/sites-available/staging.delta.chat
sudo service nginx reload
```

Now I could comment out the js redirects in `/var/www/html/_site/index.html` and
could debug the nginx redirects properly.

Debugging was a pain, but after 2 hours I got most of the test cases working.
I committed the changes to etckeeper and copied the file to this repository.

Many things didn't work because my browser plugin for emptying the cache was
not reliable. Several times I made unnecessary changes which didn't work,
because i thought it was broken when it wasn't. Testing it with curl was very
helpful, because, curl doesn't have a cache. For some cases I needed to added
headers manually though, e.g. "Accept-Language:" or "Referer:" headers.

When everything worked, I redirected get.delta.chat & download.delta.chat to
https://delta.chat/download, which in turn redirects the users to
https://delta.chat/$lang/download, where $lang is the user's browser language.

### Page Previews

Then I decided to push the preview builds of deltachat-pages pull-requests to
the new staging page, as I didn't have use for it anymore.

For this I changed the nginx config of staging.delta.chat, so it displays the
previews. It works like this:
- On https://staging.delta.chat, you can see a list of all open & closed PRs.
  You can use the link to access their preview.
- The link gets displayed in the PR checks as well, through a GitHub action.
- When a PR gets closed or merged, the preview gets replaced with a file which
  says that it's outdated and has been removed.

Because the links to the blogposts are not relative to the blog page, but
absolute, they were always broken in the previews. I created a redirect rule to
match those absolute links, which repairs the links based on the referer and
redirects the page visitors to the version of the blgopost they want to visit.

Another nice **to do** would be to create a cron job which deletes the folders
of the outdated previews, as with the preview desktop builds (see
https://github.com/deltachat/sysadmin/tree/master/download.delta.chat#delete-builds-from-closed-prs
)

## Forum Redirect

Author: missytake@systemli.org

In November 2019 treefit asked me for a redirect from forum.delta.chat to
support.delta.chat.  I added a CNAME entry for forum.delta.chat at Hetzner:

```
forum		IN CNAME	delta.chat.
```

After that, I created an nginx config file for forum.delta.chat which did a
redirect, linked to it in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`, reloaded nginx, and
created a Let's Encrypt certificate for forum.delta.chat with certbot.

```
sudo vim forum.delta.chat
sudo ln -rs /etc/nginx/sites-available/forum.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/forum.delta.chat
sudo service nginx reload
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Now, forum.delta.chat gets redirected to support.delt.chat. The nginx
configuration file is also in this repository.

## Changelog Redirect

On 2019-12-11, treefit asked for a redirect from https://delta.chat/a5f/ to
https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#09000---2019-12-11.

I added a rewrite rule, reloaded nginx, and committed it to etckeeper.

## Adjusting the delta.chat 404 page

On 2020-01-02, I changed the 404 page of delta.chat to
https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/blob/master/404.html

I reloaded nginx, committed the changes to etckeeper, and copied the nginx
config to this repository.

## Turn off logging of IP addresses with nginx

When I was translating the privacy policy of delta.chat to english, I realized
that we don't use netlify anymore, so we have to change it anyway - but also,
that we still log IP addresses with nginx. We don't need this data and I don't
want to write it into the privacy policy, so I changed the log format of
delta.chat and download.delta.chat, so it doesn't collect IP addresses anymore.

I committed the changes to etckeeper and copied the changed nginx configs to this
repository.

## Set up bots.delta.chat

On 2020-02-19, I set up static pages for bots.delta.chat. They are
automatically generated and pushed from this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/deltachat-bot/bot-pages/

### DNS settings

First I created the following DNS entries at hetzner.com:

```
bots                     IN A       37.218.242.41
bots                     IN AAAA    2a00:c6c0:0:151:5::41
bot                      IN CNAME   bots.delta.chat.
staging.bots             IN CNAME   bots.delta.chat.
staging.bot              IN CNAME   staging.bots.delta.chat.
```

### Setting up the folders

Then I created the directories on the server, where both bots.delta.chat and staging.bots.delta.chat should be reachable afterwards:

```
cd /var/www/html/
sudo mkdir bot
sudo mkdir bot-staging
```

### GitHub action to copy it to correct location

The pull request for the GitHub actions is here:
https://github.com/deltachat-bot/bot-pages/pull/12

I added the following two lines to /etc/cron.d/delete-old-builds, because the
action can't delete a folder, it can just overwrite the content:

```
*/10 * * * * root find /var/www/html/staging/ -size 24c | awk '{system("rm -r " $1)}'
*/10 * * * * root find /var/www/html/bot-staging/ -size 24c | awk '{system("rm -r " $1)}'
```

#### Secret Management

For the jekyll setup, we need to configure the bot-pages repository so it can
write to the `/var/www/html/bot` and `/var/www/html/bot-staging` directory on
the server, which is served to the outside by nginx. 

Everyone in the deltachat-bot GitHub organization theoretically has access to
this, so I decided not to use the same secret which is already accessible to
everyone in the deltachat GitHub organization.

So first I added a new user `botkyll` for GitHub to login, without sudo, but
push rights to `/var/www/html/bot` and `/var/www/html/bot-staging`. I saved the
password to my personal password manager.

```
sudo adduser botkyll
sudo chown botkyll:botkyll /var/www/html/bot* -R
```

Then I generated a SSH key for botkyll on my local machine.  I also added the
SSH key of botkyll to `/home/jekyll/.ssh/authorized_keys`, so GitHub can login
there.

```
sudo mkdir /home/botkyll/.ssh
sudo vim /home/botkyll/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chown botkyll:botkyll -R /home/botkyll/.ssh
```

I also had to limit access of the key to scp and rsync, with the rssh tool.
I set it up like this:

```
sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/rssh botkyll
cd /home/botkyll
sudo chmod u-w * -R
sudo chmod u-w .* -R
sudo vim /etc/rssh.conf
```

I also added the SSH username & key to the repository secrets, so GitHub is
able to push to the server.

### NGINX

Next I created the NGINX configurations for bots.delta.chat &
staging.bots.delta.chat:

```
sudo cp delta.chat bots.delta.chat
sudo cp staging.delta.chat staging.bots.delta.chat
sudo cp get.delta.chat bot.delta.chat
sudo vim staging.bots.delta.chat	# adjust config to our needs: deliver /var/www/html/bot-staging
sudo vim bots.delta.chat  		# adjust config to our needs: deliver /var/www/html/bot
sudo vim bot.delta.chat                 # adjust config to our needs: redirect to bots
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bots.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bots.delta.chat
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/staging.bots.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/staging.bots.delta.chat
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bot.delta.chat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bot.delta.chat
sudo service nginx reload
```

When it worked in the browser, I committed the changes to etckeeper and copied
the nginx config files to this repository.

### Let's Encrypt

Finally I generated Let's Encrypt certificates for the two domains:

```
sudo certbot --nginx
# 2: bots.delta.chat
# 2: Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
sudo certbot --nginx
# 3: staging.bots.delta.chat
# 2: Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
sudo certbot --nginx
# 2: bot.delta.chat
# 2: Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
```

## Setting up js.delta.chat

On 2020-02-25, I set up js.delta.chat on this server. For details, see https://github.com/deltachat/sysadmin/tree/master/js.delta.chat

## Setting up Nightly Android Builds

On 2020-03-18, I set up nightly android builds on this servers. For details, see https://github.com/deltachat/sysadmin/tree/master/download.delta.chat#android-nightlys

## Removing Norwegian Translation From Delta Chat

After https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/pull/328 was merged, there
were also modifications in the nginx config necessary, so the language redirect
didn't cause 404 errors.

I removed "nb" from the nginx config, reloaded nginx, committed the changes to
etckeeper, and copied the modified config to this repository.

## Hardening NGINX

On 2020-04-23, we were notified that another server still supported TLS 1.0 and
TLS 1.1. I realized this was also valid for page, and other servers with NGINX.
Both in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and in /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf
was TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 allowed.

So I disallowed it in both config files, and removed the value in nginx.conf,
as it's overwritten by the let's encrypt config anyway.

I committed the changes to etckeeper.

## Adding security backports

On 2020-01-27, a critical vulnerability in sudo was published, "Baron Samedit".
I patched all our servers - but on delta.chat I noticed that there was no new
version of sudo available from the repositories. So I (wrongly) added the
following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:

```
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security buster/updates main contrib non-free
```

After that I ran `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to patch the
vulnerability. But it didn't upgrade sudo, and when I tried to do `sudo apt
upgrade sudo`, it showed broken packages.

Then I realized that I accidentally added the buster upgrades, not stretch,
which would be debian 9. So I corrected every mention of `buster` in
/etc/apt/sources.list to `stretch` and redid `sudo apt update && sudo apt
upgrade -y`. After that, `apt policy sudo` showed the correct version number.

## Adding more languages

On 2021-03-21, I was notified of
https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/issues/401.  The languages had
already been merged, but the automated browser language detection didn't work
yet for those languages.

So I changed the NGINX config to include them as well, reloaded nginx, tested
it, and committed it to etckeeper:

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo etckeeper commit "Added zh_CN, gl, cs, tr, id to browser language detection"
```

## Upgrading page to Debian 10

Authors: missytake@systemli.org and jankass@freepoterie.fr

On 2021-04-06 we wanted to upgrade page to Debian 10, to be able to offer
TLSv1.3 on our websites. The nginx version which was installed by default on
Debian 9 didn't offer TLSv1.2 and threw a warning when we tried to apply a new
config:

```
[warn] invalid value "TLSv1.3" in /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf:10
```

First we checked which debian version and which services page was running:

```
$ uname -a
Linux page 4.14.85 #1 SMP Wed Dec 5 12:54:02 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ sudo service --status-all
 [ + ]  cron
 [ - ]  hwclock.sh
 [ + ]  kmod
 [ + ]  netfilter-persistent
 [ + ]  networking
 [ + ]  nginx
 [ + ]  ntp
 [ + ]  procps
 [ - ]  rsync
 [ + ]  rsyslog
 [ + ]  ssh
 [ - ]  sudo
 [ + ]  udev
 [ + ]  unattended-upgrades
```

## Editing the sources.list file:

First we changed all appearances of `stretch` to `buster` in
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```
deb http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free
deb http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian buster-updates main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security buster/updates main contrib non-free
```

and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/certbot.list`:

```
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
```

## Doing the Upgrade

So we continued with the upgrade:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

This asked us, if we are okay if it restarted services without asking for
permission each time - we confirmed. After that, it completed successfully
without further interruptions.

```
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

This installed the rest of the new Debian 10 packages. This asked us a few
times whether we wanted new versions of the following config files:

- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`: these changes were unnecessary, so we kept our
  version
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`: we didn't have this file before. It
  doesn't do harm, so we accepted it.
- `/etc/sysctl.conf`: we weren't sure about this one, as it was modified by our
  provider, as it seems. We kept the providers version, as we weren't sure how
  important it is.
- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: the changes were not useful, so we kept our version.

After that, it completed successfully. Now as etckeeper made a commit during
this apt run, we used `sudo etckeeper vcs commit --amend` to change the commit
message to "upgrade from Debian 9 to Debian 10".

Then we rebooted with `sudo reboot`.

After that reboot, we removed outdated packages with `sudo apt --purge
autoremove`.

## Did it work?

Then we checked whether it had worked:

```
$ hostnamectl
   Static hostname: page
         Icon name: computer-vm
           Chassis: vm
        Machine ID: 26398b58a4be4cdfa5144c3d2b4a6d38
           Boot ID: a6677d0f477847869e58430405a398c7
    Virtualization: xen
  Operating System: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
            Kernel: Linux 5.4.22
      Architecture: x86-64
```

And whether the services were still running. There was now a new dbus daemon
which we didn't have before, but apart from that, everything worked.

## Secure SSH Access

Author: missytake@systemli.org

On 2021-04-23, we realized that SSH was not protected after the best practices.
So I installed sshguard with `sudo apt install sshguard`. The default config
seemed fine, so I didn't touch anything.
